# Project1reboot

This repository is a continuation/reboot of my original "Project1" repository which I started around 8/30/19.I was getting regular errors switching between windows machines and pushing/pulling the repo, so I have now
switched to just using a single Mac for consistency and ease. This synopsis in one commit is my catch-up report to show some of the progression of what I have worked on through this past week.

My repository started with initial ambitions of making a Celsiius to Farenheit converter.  Making it convert both backwards and forwards (i.e c->f and f->c) was another pirority. I also originally stated that I would add a fun picture if time permitted.

The first day or two, I familiarized myself with the TextView boxes, and was able to add a number box and familiarize myself with the formatting. 
I also familiarized myself with what's happening in activity_main and content_main, and some MainActivity commands. 
The next few days I was able to re-familiarize myself with Java, and learned some of the similar setText commands to the java String and String.format commands.

After that, I was finally able to get the floating action buttons added to the screen, and accept and convert the input entered into the Numbox at the top of the screen.
The formatting was basic and did not have any images, but the basic structure of "click the bottom left button for celsius, and click the bottom right button for farenheit" worked.

The few days after that up until now I have been adding fun images to appear and formatting backgrounds to learn more of the GUI aspect.  
I now have an image of a bear that waves with his right paw when the "°F" is pressed, and another image of a different bear waving with his left paw when "°C" is pressed.

I will see if I can make the "enter" button activate one of the converters before submitting, although I will remove that function if I can't debug it before the due-date.
